## Overview: 
### Web initiative based around these core principles:
### Harm reduction
* Local resources like needle banks, methadone clinics, narcan delivery
Education
* Simplifying pharmacology to non-academia,  educate users on drug MOAs, contraindicated interactions(black box warning for stuff like opiates and benzos, MDMA and SRIs), and introduce the concept of diminishing or declining returns past a certain dose aka less is more, more dosing doesn't mean more high 
* Explain concepts like dopamine depletion and adrendal fatigue of binges of amphetamine/derivative phenylthamines
* Introduce potentiators with a focus on reducing harm and lessening neurotoxicity 
* Addiction treatment resources such as non 12 step meetings  

## Destigmatizing Addicts (as well as Recreational Users)
* Inspire empathy
* Educate on policy reform and the consequences of prohibition

## Data collection via peer surveys 
* Surveys to wide range of communities with special attention on trans people
* Not only drug related, could be about access to  psychiatric care, gender affirming care, etc
* Use surveys to improve reach and message
## Mental Health Awareness and Coping Skills 
* Bite sized coping skills (start with DBT skills) to help cope with their pain, possibly use less, or make healthier choices in regards to self harm / SI
* General education on different diagnoses to lessen stigma and humanize
* Referrals to local care and crisis lines

## Content catered to transspectrum people 
* Education, resources, support
* Studies that aren't usually seen like rectal progesterone's effectiveness  (created by doctor but not published in traditional academic paper)
* HRT education (injection methods, etc)
* Online and local Support groups
