### Brief Initiative Summary
* Intended, in part, to be a 'grassroots' peer data interpretation/activism initiative 
* Focusing on both providing trans-spectrum individuals with resources as well as activism; challenging stigma with solid resources
* Peer survey data intake/interpretation/publication, focusing on gathering data points on under-represented marginalized groups
* Simplifying psychiatric coping skills ('Bite-sized DBT, CBT')
* Simplifying access to resources for access to gender-affirming care, providing education to fight dangerous misconceptions utilizing both peer-reviewed academic studies as well as the trans community via data collection and interpretation

## Overview: 

### Data collection via peer surveys 
* Surveys to wide range of communities with special attention on trans people
* Topics could range in topic such as gathering data on access to psychiatric care, gender affirming care, etc
* Use surveys to improve reach and provide important content to appropiate areas of interest/concern (in-part via interpretation of data)

### Mental Health Awareness and Coping Skills [Made Easier]
* Bite sized coping skills (start with DBT skills) to help cope with their pain, possibly use less, or make healthier choices in regards to self harm / SI
* General education on different diagnoses to lessen various stigmas and help humanize frequently demonized/misunderstood indivuals
* Function: Provide applicable coping skill using streamlined questionare
* Referrals to local care and crisis lines (utilize location services or ZIP)

### Substance Harm reduction
 (noticed a large gap in resources tailored for trans addicts, need for increased awareness of an often neglected demographic)
* Local resources like needle banks, methadone clinics, narcan delivery
* Provide those affected by substance abuse/addiction with addiction resources including non-12 step meetings and harm reduction information
* Gather data on marginalized/under-surveryed groups such as trans addicts

### Content catered to transspectrum people 
* Education, resources, support
* HRT education (injection methods, etc)
* Online and local Support groups
