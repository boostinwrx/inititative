### Brief Initiative Summary
Essentially a harm reduction/'grassroots' peer data interpretation/ activism initiative focusing on a mix of frequently stigmatized/misunderstood subjects. Core principals:
* Stigma-free science-driven education about pharmacology with an emphasis on harm reduction, criminalization reform, access to local resources such as needle exchanges, Narcan, and addiction treatment resources
* Peer survey data intake/interpretation/publication, focusing on gathering data points on under-represented marginalized groups
* Simplifying psychiatric coping skills ('Bite-sized DBT, CBT')
* Transgender-Spectrum focused activism, including resources for access to gender-affirming care, providing education to fight dangerous misconceptions utilizing both peer-reviewed academic studies as well as the trans community via data collection and interpretation

## Overview: 
### Harm reduction
* Local resources like needle banks, methadone clinics, narcan delivery
Education
* Simplifying pharmacology to non-academia,  educate users on drug MOAs, contraindicated interactions(black box warning for interactions like opiates and benzodiazapines, MDMA and SRIs), and introduce the concept of diminishing or declining returns past a certain dose
* Explain concepts like dopamine depletion and adrendal fatigue of binges of amphetamine/derivative phenylthamines
* Introduce potentiators with a focus on reducing harm and lessening neurotoxicity 
* Addiction treatment resources such as non 12 step meetings  

## Destigmatizing Addicts (as well as Recreational Users)
* Inspire empathy
* Educate on policy reform and the fatal consequences of prohibition

## Data collection via peer surveys 
* Surveys to wide range of communities with special attention on trans people
* Not only drug related, could be about access to  psychiatric care, gender affirming care, etc
* Use surveys to improve reach and message

## Mental Health Awareness and Coping Skills 
* Bite sized coping skills (start with DBT skills) to help cope with their pain, possibly use less, or make healthier choices in regards to self harm / SI
* General education on different diagnoses to lessen stigma and humanize
* Referrals to local care and crisis lines

## Content catered to transspectrum people 
* Education, resources, support
* Studies that aren't usually seen like different ROAs of progesterone's effectiveness  (created by doctor but not published in traditional academic paper)
* HRT education (injection methods, etc)
* Online and local Support groups
